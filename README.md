# alala
A pipeline for the Wide-field Infra-Red Camera (WIRCam) and MegaPrime instruments at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). The pipeline does stacking, astrometry, PSF photometry and aperture photometry on images from either camera. Also included is a script to streamline making light curves.

Named after the ʻAlalā, the Hawaiian crow, known for its intelligence and flying ability.

# The project
This project was begun in May 2019 by Nicholas Vieira, working under the supervision of Dr. Daryl Haggard and Dr. John Ruan, both at McGill University/McGill Space Institute. 

This pipeline was built specifically with multi-messenger astrophysics in mind. The pipeline will, hopefully, be used to process WIRCam & MegaPrime electromagnetic follow-up of some gravitational wave source in the future.

# alala
A pipeline for the Wide-field Infra-Red Camera (WIRCam) and MegaPrime instruments at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT). The pipeline does stacking, astrometry, PSF photometry and aperture photometry on images from either camera. 

Named after the ʻAlalā, the Hawaiian crow, known for its intelligence and flying ability.

The description of what goes on "under the hood" currently needs a bit of updating, but everything works as intended. 

# The project
This project was begun in May 2019 by Nicholas Vieira, working under the supervision of Dr. Daryl Haggard and Dr. John Ruan at the McGill Space Institute. 

This pipeline was built specifically with multi-messenger astrophysics in mind. It was first used in our CFHT MegaCam follow-up campaign of the gravitational wave event GW190814, a potential neutron star black hole (NSBH) merger with an extremely low probability of being a false alarm.
